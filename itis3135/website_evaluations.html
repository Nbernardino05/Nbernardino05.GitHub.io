                <h3>Good Design: <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a></h3>
                <p>Duolingo is a language-learning platform that offers interactive lessons. This website is the company's home page and it features the benefits that the learning service provides.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast: The bright green and blue color scheme creates clear visual distinctions. The white space and bold text also make buttons and sections easy to read.</li>
                    <li><strong>R</strong>epetition: The design is consistent across pages, with similar fonts, buttons, and layouts. Icons and illustrations also maintain a cohesive cartoonish style throughout the site.</li>
                    <li><strong>A</strong>lignment: Text, buttons, and images are placed logically, guiding the user's eye smoothly. This page maintains visual balance by alternating the placement of content on both sides, creating a structured and engaging layout.</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong>roximity: Related elements (like like features and their related image) are grouped together. White space is used effectively to separate different sections, preventing clutter. Navigation menus are close to relevant content, making it intuitive.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Bad Design: <a href="https://www.buziosnyc.com/">Buzios</a></h3>
                <p>Buzios is a popular Brazilian market located in Manhattan, NY. This site mainly showcases what Brazilian products they sell as well contact and address information.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast: The light grey text on the white background in the body of the site makes the text hardly distinguishable.</li>
                    <li><strong>R</strong>epetition: There's no consistent themeâ€” each section seems to have its own font, text color, and background color that do not visually collaborate.</li>
                    <li><strong>A</strong>lignment: Elements feel randomly placed, with no clear structure or grid system. For example, the two product search bars are different sizes, are aligned differently, and use different styles. 
                        The spacing between sections is also inconsistent, adding to the disorganized look.</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong>roximity: The website applies too much space in between the elements of a section while other sections elements' appear cramped. Some sections also weird gaps or overlaps. 
                        For example, the gap above the product search bar (the second one at the end of the page) and below the products makes the two elements appear unrelated.</li>
